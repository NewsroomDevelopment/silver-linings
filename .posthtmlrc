In this tumultuous time, the collective and individual anxiety, grief, burnout, and isolation has made it difficult to recall the joys found in everyday life. Yet, in some ways, this year has granted us unique opportunities for self-reflection and mindfulness. Our team of illustrators has come together to illustrate how we’ve been getting through the semester and the year by recognizing those bright spots of creativity, joy, and growth."

We asked our illustrators to find and illustrate their silver linings, no matter how big or small, in the clouds of the past year. We hope that our silver linings inspire you to visualize your own, as you reflect on the moments that got you through the semester."

This quarantine, I rediscovered the places and people that will forever be my home."
