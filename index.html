In this tumultuous time, the collective and individual anxiety, grief, burnout, and isolation has made it difficult to recall the joys found in everyday life. Yet, in some ways, this year has granted us unique opportunities for self-reflection and mindfulness. Our team of illustrators has come together to illustrate how we’ve been getting through the semester and the year by recognizing those bright spots of creativity, joy, and growth. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> A “silver lining” refers to the shining edges of a cloud backlit by the sun; metaphorically, it means the small moments of hope, calm, and joy found in a dark time. We asked our illustrators to find and illustrate their silver linings, no matter how big or small, in the clouds of the past year. We hope that our silver linings inspire you to visualize your own, as you reflect on the moments that got you through the semester. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/I324CT2NZVBPRE5FDAHOLD5YYE.gif"> <p class="image-caption-text"> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Sadia:</b> I had to confront my anxiety a lot more during the pandemic.

During the early 2020 lockdown, amidst the stress, isolation, and anxiety, I was also able to appreciate and take awe at the grandeur of natural occurrences such as this. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/FBX7FZR5EFCQVCZM7D7HAQNMJM.jpeg"> <p class="image-caption-text"> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Magan:</b> During the pandemic, I embraced the joy of cooking and baking!

The woods were safe, grounding. As the world was falling apart, the flowers bloomed again, the creeks finally ran clear, the trees welcomed me home. After a month of isolation, a few of my high school friends and I formed a quarantine bubble. Crossing streams, laying in the grass, talking about everything, it was a chance to grow back together. This quarantine, I rediscovered the places and people that will forever be my home. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/GDLYXYVKGNEZ7EC7ECDI4B4BCI.gif"> <p class="image-caption-text"> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b> Noelle: </b>One of the positive things about this last year is that I’ve been able to paint some lovely, socially distanced, plein air watercolors around NYC. </p> <div class="image width-auto"> <img src="https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/spectator/GDLYXYVKGNEZ7EC7ECDI4B4BCI.gif"> <p class="image-caption-text"> </p> </div> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <b>Jules: </b>During the pandemic, I’ve had more time to appreciate the bird population at home in Wisconsin.
